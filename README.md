# Project-1

this is mainly to see how well my coding skills are, what type of data strcutures and algorithms I can implement, or how good my problem solving skills are

## Inspiration Behind This App
I see a lot of this happen, in class groupchats, and even in discord chats, students become upset because their professors don't post the class notes online, and they're left scrambling looking wherever to find help on the topic. The website (and app) that I plan on building will eliminate some of that stress. This website is for college students, built by a college student

## Function
Let's say, person A misses class one day, he/she asks his/her class mate, person B if he/she can send a picture of the notes, person B sends him/her a picture of the notes, but to person A's lack of knowledge, he/she doesn't know that person B isn't the best at paying attention in class and taking notes, so come the next class meeting, person A has a quiz on a lesson she previously missed, but fails because she depended on the notes from person B. Thanks to person A's lack of social skills, she doesn't communicate with with anyone else in that class but Person B. My plan is to have sort of a social media, but for class notes, where students from the same class are free to post their notes and see their classmates notes, without the stress of having to meet every individual person in their class. In college, who has time or the effort for that? This is just the beginning of this project, I have other ideas as well but for now, this is the main function of my project. It will be called Peer Source.
